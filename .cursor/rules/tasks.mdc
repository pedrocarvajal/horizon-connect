Always, whenever the user asks for something, you must review your current task list and update it with the new instructions, managing it through the todo_write tool.

First, evaluate the taskâ€™s impact and complexity. Based on this evaluation, break down large tasks into smaller, well-organized, sequential subtasks to achieve the objectives. Additionally, always include at the end a task for a second critical validation, to re-analyze the implementation and ensure it was executed correctly without causing issues or side effects.
