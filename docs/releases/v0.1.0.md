## Notes

This initial release establishes the foundation for the Horizon Connect algorithmic trading framework. The framework is designed for backtesting trading strategies with plans for future production trading capabilities. The architecture supports extensibility through interfaces and modular services, making it easy to add new assets, strategies, indicators, and exchange integrations.

Known limitations in this release:

- Production trading functionality is planned for future releases
- Additional exchange gateways (Interactive Brokers, KuCoin) are in development
- Optimization service implementation is pending

Future enhancements will focus on expanding exchange integrations, adding more technical indicators, implementing portfolio optimization, and introducing production trading capabilities.
